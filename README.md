FACILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


This is a Web App Project entitled to SAM NUJOMA ESTATE. This web-based application is a ESTATE COMMUNITY MANAGEMTN software. The system manages the tenants' properties through, Utility billings/charges, Community forum disccussion platform and Service Agent management and other related information. The system has 2 sides of users which are the admin side and client-side. The tenant-side of the system has a secure login and it contains the tenants' details of his/her personal/company/business details. The admin side is the side of the system where admin can manages the tenants needs and the data in the system.
The Facility Management System was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery and Ajax), and some other plugins/libraries such as AdminLTE and Bootstrap. As I have mentioned above, the system has an admin side/panel and this side can be managed by another user also but with some restrictions according to their user levels. The system is a data-driven application that can be edited to suit your need. It has a pleasant user interface and user-friendly functionalities.
